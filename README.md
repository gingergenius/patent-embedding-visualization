By default, only a small dataset (ca. 300 patents) about hair dryers is available. Download other datasets (video codec, 3D printer, contact lens) for the folder `/demo/data` at 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XUuUfL_HCaxcza2RczJTROMhr5h0IiOg?usp=sharing'.


The contact lens dataset is the most interesting one and it was used in the evaluation of the proposed visualization approach.
