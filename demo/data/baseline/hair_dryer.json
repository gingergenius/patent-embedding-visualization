The hair dryer includes sound absorbing material attached to the inner surface of the hair dryer housing and having a selected density to provide maximum sound absorption in a relatively thin layer of material. A motor with integral fan is mounted on the hair dryer handle by an elastomeric vibration isolator so as to be isolated from the dryer housing. The fan blade noise, in part absorbed by the sound absorbing material on the inner surface of the hair dryer housing, is further grossly suppressed by special sound absorbing structures located at the extreme inlet and outlet of the housing, such as a structure functioning as a Helmholtz resonator, with that structure itself being vibration isolated from the hair dryer housing. Preferably an aerodynamically designed heater is used downstream of the fan to minimize the vortex noise. Also, vibration isolation between the handle and the main housing assembly provides good low frequency vibration absorption, particularly with the motor being supported through the handle rather than through the main housing itself. Various embodiments and other features of the invention are also disclosed.","claims_text":"We claim: \n     \n       1.
